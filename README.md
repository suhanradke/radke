# # Welcome to your Repo Team 3...
This Read me file serves the purpose of helping you initialize your repository on your local machine and giving you examples of how to use this repository. To reiterate some things I said in class.

1. This Repository is private and can only be viewed by whomever I give permission to view it.
2. Once Final presentations are over I will transfer ownership of the repository to whomever wants it. 
3. I will delete all repositories that are unclaimed on June 1st.
4. Doc will be able to view your repository and might consider your commits as a portion of your grades.

The first thing I would like everyone to do is edit this text file and commit it to the repo and include their names below
John doe
Betty White
Harambe
ETC....

This will be a great excersize with GIT and help you become familar with the process. (HINT you can just edit this text file from the browser if you are mondo lazy). 

There are 2 ways to interface with your repo. You can use Command Line Git or a GUI (Such as source tree, GitHub GUI, or whatever you want to use I really dont care). The benefits are cut and dry. Command Line Git is straight forward and powerful, but you have to understand Command Line. GUI is simple and easy but not as powerful (Or cool in my opinion).
