# Welcome to your Repo Team 3...
This Read me file serves the purpose of helping you initialize your repository on your local machine and giving you examples of how to use this repository. It will also serve as a good reference file. To reiterate some things I said in class.

1. This Repository is private and can only be viewed by whomever I give permission to view it.
2. Once Final presentations are over I will transfer ownership of the repository to whomever wants it. 
3. I will delete all repositories that are unclaimed on June 1st.
4. Doc will be able to view your repository and might consider your commits as a portion of your grades.

The first thing I would like everyone to do is edit this text file and commit it to the repo and include their names below
John doe
Betty White
Harambe
ETC....

This will be a great excersize with GIT and help you become familar with the process. (HINT you can just edit this text file from the browser if you are mondo lazy). 

There are 2 ways to interface with your repo. You can use Command Line Git or a GUI (Such as source tree, GitHub GUI, GitExtensions or whatever you want to use I really dont care). The benefits are cut and dry. Command Line Git is straight forward and powerful, but you have to understand Command Line. GUI is simple and easy but not as powerful (Or cool in my opinion). Be aware that most GUIs have access to a command line instance of GIT.

To work with Git I suggest referencing a pluralsight course, or the Git CLI Documentation -> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line

Pluralsight -> https://www.pluralsight.com/

Pluralsight is a website that has video tutorials for technologies that you might find helpful. A similar website that might also help is https://www.lynda.com/

The basics of Git are simple. I will be refering to GIT VERBS in all caps to help keep consistency. In Summary, You will have a local Git repository of code on your machine. You can CHECKOUT different branches of this repo. When you CHECKOUT a branch you make a copy of it and it becomes a new branch. When you make a change to a branch you then have to ADD the changes and COMMIT the changes. Then you can MERGE that branch into your master branch. Then PUSH that branch to your remote repository. This remote repository is whats on Github and what your teammates can access. The work flow for adding code to this branch goes as follows.

1. CHECKOUT new branch
2. Make changes and test
3. ADD to your new branch and commit them to your new branch
4. MERGE into your Local Repo
5. PUSH to your Remote Repository

While I would strongly suggest you DO NOT work on your master branch. You can do everything without having to create new branches and merge them back into the master branch. THis is not best practice. This work flow above is only a suggestion for one way to use GIT. Research GIT and play with it. That is the only way you will learn it. 

Other important information.... Take time choosing your project. Make sure you are gonna enjoy making whatever it is you want to create.
Things to research.. Bootstrap, Javascript, Frameworks, PHP, HTML5 Canvas, DATABASES & SQL, NODE, Backend vs Frontend.
Get a idea of what things you would like to work on and start attempting to learn things about them. I would strongly recommend using pluralsight or lynda as a resource. I believe you can get 6 months of pluralsight for free as a student. Also don't be afraid to ask questions to the volunteers that come to class everyday, they are here to help you succeed!
